*   **Conventional Commits**: Always use conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).
*   **Branching**: Create a new branch for each new topic/task. Do not work directly on `main` unless instructed.
*   **Attribution**: When you (the agent) are the sole author of a commit:
    *   Prefix the commit title with `🤖 `.
    *   Add `(Authored by Antigravity)` to the commit body.
